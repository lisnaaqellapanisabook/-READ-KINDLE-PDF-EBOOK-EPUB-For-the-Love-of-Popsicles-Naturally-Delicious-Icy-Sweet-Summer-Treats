For the Love of Popsicles: Naturally Delicious Icy Sweet Summer Treats from A–Z by Sarah Bond Book Review

Rating: 4.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Great Book (with a few caveats)
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 20, 2023
Review: This book has some really excellent popsicle recipes that are approachable and beautiful. If you're the kind of person who would buy a whole cookbook for popsicles, then I'd recommend this book with a few caveats.

The recipes typically make (8) 2oz. pops. The photos are almost all of 4oz pops, which is consistent with a typical adult sized popsicle. Since the whole recipe makes 16 oz, I typically have to increase the recipe by 1.5 times to fill my Tovolo Groovy (6) 4oz. popsicle molds. Or make the recipe as written and get (4-5) 4 oz. pops.

About half of the recipes (often the fancier recipes) require a blender. I didn't have a blender, so I could only look longingly at the photos of Caramel Macchiato and Oatmeal Chocolate Chip popsicles.

Some of the recipes haven't turned out quite right. The Marshmallow Coconut Creme didn't look like the photo with an even, aerated appearance. I couldn't keep the meringue mixture fluffy and it separated in the freezer. The "Any Jelly" pops became impossible to get out of the mold because of the layering of jelly and yogurt. Perhaps it was user error, but popsicles aren't on my list of foods that can reasonably require any skill to make. They were all delicious though and easy enough that I would try again.

Review: My daughter loves popsicles and has since her first taste as a toddler. She thinks this book is the very best with it’s colorful pictures and healthy popsicle recipes. She had already made me a shopping list so that she can start making popsicles shown in the book. Thank you!

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Good info, weird recipes
Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 1, 2023
Review: The info on making popsicles is very helpful. Most of the recipes are odd. I don't know why anyone would want a big slice of fruit or a big spray of herbs in a popsicle. I don't know how you would eat that. Seeds and nuts? It makes great photos but does not look appetizing. Does anyone like chewing on a frozen stawberry or apple? It would get mushy trying to bite it.

Date: Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 10, 2021
Review: I love this book of popsicle recipes! I checked it out at my local library and enjoyed it so much that I had to buy it for myself. We have already made a lot of the recipes so far this summer. I make them in my Zoku mod pop molds, which makes 6 popsicles from each recipe (the recipes are written for 8 slightly smaller pops).

I love that the recipes call for simple ingredients, use less-refined sweeteners where possible, and are largely gluten free (only a few exceptions, like cookies & creme, but even that is doable if you find GF oreos).

My favorites so far have been cappuccino, orange creamsicle (orange juice, banana, yogurt, vanilla--surprisingly on point), and arnold palmer. I think I'll try chocolate chip cookie dough next. My husband's favorite was cherry limeade, which had chunky bing cherries and a tart lime aftertaste.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Great book, with pictures of each popsicle

Review: It has a good balance of general tips and theory overview and “get to it” recipe pages.
It covers creamy as well as more traditional “icy” treats and also has a number of “boozy” pops.
The pictures are appealing and all in all makes the subject matter look interesting yet not overwhelming, which is about what I can handle in this maybe-post-covid-new-normal period.
